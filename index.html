  <ul>
    <li>Early Life & Education</li>
    <p>Dr. Hawa Abdi was born in 1947 in Mogadishu, Somalia. She lost her mother at the age of 12, which inspired her to pursue medicine to help others. She received a scholarship to study in the Soviet Union and graduated from Kiev Medical Institute in Ukraine in 1971 as a doctor. She later studied law at Somali National University.</p>
    <li>Medical & Humanitarian Work</li>
    <p>After completing her studies, Dr. Hawa Abdi returned to Somalia and worked as a doctor. In 1983, she established a small one-room clinic in Afgooye, about 20 km from Mogadishu, to help women and children. This clinic later expanded into a 400-bed hospital and a refugee camp, which provided shelter, food, and medical care to thousands of Somalis displaced by civil war.

During the Somali Civil War (1991â€“2020), her hospital became a sanctuary for over 90,000 internally displaced people, mostly women and children. Despite threats from militias, she stood firm and continued her humanitarian work. In 2010, armed militants attempted to take control of her hospital, but she refused and demanded they leave.</p>
<li>Challenges & Recognition</li>
<p>Dr. Hawa faced many challenges, including attacks from armed groups and lack of funding, but she never gave up. Her courage and dedication earned her global recognition. She received several awards, including:
  <div id="center"><li>The BET Humanitarian Award (2012)</li>
  <li>Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
  <li>Listed in "The 100 Most Influential People in the World" by TIME Magazine (2010)</li></div>
</p>
<li>Legacy & Death</li>
<p>Dr. Hawa Abdi passed away on August 5, 2020, but her legacy lives on through her daughters, who continue her work in the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF). She remains a symbol of resilience, courage, and service to humanity in Somalia and beyond</p>
